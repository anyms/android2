Over three episodes, we will look at the changing face of modern warfare across the land, sea and air domains through the prism of three key technology areas - Satellite communications, Line-of-sight datalinks, and cybersecurity. We will hear from senior military leaders about the changing nature of today\u2019s threats, and how unfettered access across the electromagnetic spectrum can no longer be taken for granted. We will find out about the vulnerabilities facing these critical technology areas, look at the work going on to protect military networks and hear how the private sector is stepping in to help. In particular, we will look at the Five Eyes grouping of countries - Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US - and find out how prepared their militaries are when the connectivity they have become accustomed to is degraded or denied. And we will hear from our sponsor Viasat about how the private sector is stepping in to help militaries further develop these technology areas further.", "title_highlighted": "Five Eyes Connectivity ", "title_original": "Five Eyes Connectivity ", "publisher_highlighted": "Shephard Studio", "publisher_original": "Shephard Studio", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/five-eyes-connectivity-o1FahSWRdB3-p6CdmXfoi2a.300x300.jpg", "thumbnail": "https://cdn-images-1.listennotes.com/podcasts/five-eyes-connectivity-o1FahSWRdB3-p6CdmXfoi2a.300x300.jpg", "itunes_id": 1480587783, "latest_pub_date_ms": 1569495600000, "earliest_pub_date_ms": 1568790000003, "id": "71e8be5073fc4ff39da514e9ac9a1ec3", "genre_ids": [127, 131, 95, 99], "listennotes_url": "https://www.listennotes.com/c/71e8be5073fc4ff39da514e9ac9a1ec3/", "total_episodes": 4, "email": "Please upgrade to the PRO plan to see this field", "explicit_content": false, "website": "https://www.shephardmedia.com/studio/?utm_source=listennotes.com&utm_campaign=Listen+Notes&utm_medium=website"}, {"rss": "Please upgrade to the PRO plan to see this field", "description_highlighted": "...With our team of experts, we are able to deliver on our promise \u2014 to help defend and secure your network and endpoints;
